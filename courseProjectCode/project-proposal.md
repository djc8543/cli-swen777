# Project Proposal: Enhancing HTTPie

## Project Overview

HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client designed as human friendly as possible. It provides an intuitive user interface, JSON support, syntax highlighting, and support for plugins and extensions. HTTPie simplifies testing and interacting with HTTP APIs, making it a popular tool among developers, testers, and system administrators.

This project focuses on contributing enhancements to the HTTPie open-source project while ensuring code quality, maintainability, and usability. The main goals are:

- Familiarize ourselves with HTTPie’s architecture and testing framework.  
- Create quality metric gathering tools and perform analyses based on these metrics.  
- Extend or improve existing functionality through bug fixes, new features, or optimizations.  
- Ensure any modifications align with HTTPie’s philosophy of user-friendliness and developer experience.  
- Collaborate using GitHub workflows (branches, pull requests, and code reviews).

Deliverables include code contributions, improved documentation, and automated test coverage to validate correctness.

## Key Quality Attributes

The following report summarizes this team’s findings pertaining to quality attributes gathered from HTTPie’s codebase. The objective of this report is to provide insights into the maintainability of the codebase, with a focus on code structure and test robustness. All Quality Attributes were calculated programmatically, aside from test coverage percentage, which was already available through the official repository. This analysis focuses exclusively on Python source files, excluding other files such as, but not limited to, markup, setup scripts, and documentation.

1. Codebase size and structure  
* *Average LOC per file \= 134.5*  
* *Total SLOC \= 14028*  
  The fairly moderate average lines of code metric would suggest that the codebase is well structured, where most files have a strong singular focus. Functionality seems to be well isolated, preventing overly large or complex files.  
    
2. Documentation  
* *Total comments \= 794*  
* *Comment density for source lines only \= 6%*  
  The relatively low comment density of HHTPie suggests one of two things; either the files are written in such a way that most of the code is self-explanatory, or there is a lack of adequate documentation that may cause confusion for open source developers.  
    
3. Complexity  
* *Average cyclomatic complexity \= \~2.75*  
  This low average cyclomatic complexity, which Radon rates an A, indicates a straight-forward control structure. As a result, functions should be easy to test and maintain, while also benefitting from reduced risk of bugs and ease of refactoring.

4. Testing Quality  
* *Total number of tests \= 410*  
* *Test coverage \= 95%*  
  For a simple CLI tool, which is not meant for critical operations, this is a strong showing in terms of testing. The high coverage percentage indicates an extensive suite of tests that cover nearly all the functionality that HHTPie provides.  
    
5. Conclusion  
   Overall, HTTPie’s codebase showcases impressive quality attributes across the areas we are focusing on. We see manageable file sizes with low complexity, a control structure that keeps the codebase maintainable, scalable, and modifiable, and a testing suite that encompasses nearly all the possible functionalities being provided to users. Our only critique would be that the comment density is well below industry averages, which can range anywhere from 15%-25%, depending on the source. This leaves a solid opportunity for our team to come in and improve inline documentation in an effort to shore up the one apparent gap in HTTPie’s code quality, improving the development experience for those who come after.
