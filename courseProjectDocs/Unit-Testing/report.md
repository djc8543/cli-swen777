* test_utils.py

1. `test_is_version_greater_value_error()`
    -  The function is_version_greater(a, b) determines if version a > b. It loops over the versions and finds each '.', from there is attempts to convert the string to a number. If it fails to convert to a number, it stops at the last '.' and then does the comparison. When it does fail to convert, it throws an exception, this exception is never tested
2. `test_humanize_bytes()`
    - The function humanize_bytes(n, precision) takes in a number of bytes along with a decimal precision value and converts the number into a human readable value, such as MB, GB, TB, ... This function is never tested since it is never called inside of the HTTPIE repo, however, the function itself is public, meaning that it can be called. HTTPIE has a plugin tool, meaning that this function can be used by developers and needs to be tested
3. `test_open_with_lockfile_file_exists_error()`
    - The function open_with_lockfile(file, args**) attepts to open the specified file with the appropriate args, these arguments being all types of file operations (r, w). Before opening the file, it checks to see if the file is in a locked state, meaning that the file is open in another location. When it does detect a lock, it throws an exception, this exception is never tested.

* test_plugins_cli.py

4. `test_auth_plugin_get_auth_raises()`
    - The function get_auth(username, password) is found within the AuthPlugin class. This class is not implemented directly inside of HTTPIE but it does provide an interface which can be implemented by external plugin systems. Since the functions inside of AuthPlugin are not implemented, they all throw a NotImplementedError, this error throwing is never tested.
* test_output.py

5. `test_colorstring_or_styled_generic_color`
    - The class ColorString is used as a decorator for UI output seen by the user. The user may set what this styling property is. Once the color is styled it becomes a _StyledGenericColor, when combined with a base value such as BOLD, the list of decorated properties on that color extends, this logic is never tested.

* test_man_pages.py

6. `test_is_available_short_circuits()`
    - This test verifies that when NO_MAN_PAGES is set to True, the is_available() function immediately returns False without calling the man command and entering the subprocess try block.

7. `test_is_available_success_returncode_zero()`
    - This test simulates a successful man 1 http execution by mocking subprocess.run to return a 0 exit code, which ensures that is_availabe is correctly returing true.
8. `test_is_available_not_found_nonzero()`
    - This test mocks subprocess.run to return a non-zero exit code, which mimicks the case where there is no manual page which is present in the program. It ensures that is_available is correctly returing False.

9. `test_is_available_exception_path()`
    - This test forces subprocess.run to raise an OSError which tests the exception block returns False if theres any exception.

10. `test_display_for_calls_man_with_env_streams()`
    - This test ensures that display_for calls the system man command with the correct arguments and correctly routes output and error streams to the provided Environment.
